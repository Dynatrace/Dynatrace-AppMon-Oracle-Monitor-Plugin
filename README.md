## Oracle Monitor Plugin

The Oracle Monitor plugin enables monitoring the values provided in Oracle's v$ tables.The plugin uses JDBC to connect to the Oracle Database and queries the most important metrics from these tables.
Having these measures in dynaTrace enables quick correlation of database related performance issues such as high I/O or too many database connections to application transaction performance problems
such as long running transactions or slow database queries.
